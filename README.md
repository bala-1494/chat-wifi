## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Requirements:**
- All devices MUST be on the same WiFi network (same router)
- This will NOT work across different networks or over the internet
- Some corporate/university networks may block this type of communication

‚ö†Ô∏è **Firewall:**
- Your firewall may need to allow Python/Streamlit to access the network
- Ports used: 37020 (discovery) and 37021 (chat)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Running on Multiple Devices:**
- Each device should run its own instance of the app
- Make sure to use different ports if running multiple instances on the same device

## Troubleshooting

**Can't see nearby chats?**
- Make sure all devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check firewall settings
- Try manually entering the PIN and IP address

**Connection failed?**
- Verify the IP address is correct
- Check if the host is still running the app
- Ensure ports 37020 and 37021 aren't blocked

**Messages not sending?**
- Check your internet connection
- Try leaving and rejoining the chat
- Restart the app

## Technical Details

- **Discovery Protocol**: UDP broadcast on port 37020
- **Chat Protocol**: TCP on port 37021
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Communication**: Python sockets

## Limitations

- Only works on local network (same WiFi)
- Not encrypted (don't send sensitive information)
- Basic implementation - not production-ready
- Messages are not stored/persisted

## Future Enhancements

- End-to-end encryption
- Message history
- File sharing
- Group chat features
- Better error handling
- User avatars
